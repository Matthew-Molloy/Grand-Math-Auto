Grand Math Auto is an educational racing game that utilizes and Android Wear accelerometer to control steering, thus simulating a more realistic driving experience. The game has two main elements, the solving of math problems and the dodging of cones on the road. Cones appear randomly in front of the player, and must be dodged to prevent a game over. Math problems will constantly appear in the upper right corner. If these problems are not solved by typing in the correct answer, the game will speed up and become significantly more difficult.

Controls:
Solving Math Problem: NumPad or regular numeric keyboard input
Steering: Arrow keys or Android Wear rotation
Menu: Arrow Keys or flicking of wrist while wearing Android Wear connected device
